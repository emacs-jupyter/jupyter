;;; Commentary:

;; Integrate the Jupyter REST API contents endpoint with Emacs' file handling
;; facilities for remote files. Adds two new remote file methods, /jpy: and
;; /jpys:, the former being HTTP connections and the latter being HTTPS
;; connections.
;;
;; If you run a local notebook server on port 8888 then reading and writing
;; files to the server is as easy as
;;
;;     (write-region "xxxx" nil "/jpy:localhost:happy.txt")
;;
;; or
;;
;;     (find-file "/jpy:localhost:serious.py")
;;
;; To open a `dired' listing to the base directory of the notebook server
;;
;;     (dired "/jpy:localhost:/")
;;
;; You can change the default port by changing the `tramp-default-port' entry
;; of the jpy or jpys method in `tramp-methods' or you can specify a port
;; inline using something like /jpy:localhost#8888:/.
;;
;; You can also set an entry in `tramp-default-host-alist' like
;;
;;     (add-to-list 'tramp-default-host-alist (list "jpy" nil "HOST"))
;;
;; Then specifying filenames like /jpy::/foo is equivalent to /jpy:HOST:
;;
;; TODO: Same messages for implemented file operations that TRAMP and Emacs
;; give.
;;
;; TODO: How can checkpoints be used with: `auto-save-mode',
;; `diff-latest-backup-file', ...
