;;; Commentary:

;; Implement the `jupyter-comm-layer' interface on-top of a `jupyter-ioloop'.
;; Note this class only implements a subset of the `jupyter-comm-layer'
;; interface needed for a `jupyter-kernel-client' and is usually sub-classed to
;; be usable by a `jupyter-kernel-client'.  See `jupyter-channel-ioloop-comm'.

;;; Code:

(require 'jupyter-comm-layer)
(require 'jupyter-ioloop)

(defclass jupyter-ioloop-comm (jupyter-comm-layer)
  ((ioloop :type jupyter-ioloop))
  :abstract t)

;; Fall back method that catches IOLoop events that have not been handled by
;; the communication layer already.

                                      event)
  (unless (memq (car event) '(start quit))
