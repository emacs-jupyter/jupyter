;;; Commentary:

;; Communication with a kernel can happen in various ways, e.g. through zmq
;; sockets, a websocket, and potentially others.
;;
;; The purpose of this file is to implement a kernel communication layer to
;; abstract away how a client communicates with the kernel it is connected to.
;;
;; A specific kernel communication layer (kcomm for short) is implemented by
;; extending the methods: `jupyter-comm-start', `jupyter-comm-stop',
;; `jupyter-comm-alive-p',`jupyter-event-handler', `jupyter-send', and possibly
;; `jupyter-initialize-connection'.
;;
;; A client registers with the kcomm by calling `jupyter-connect-client' and
;; de-registers with `jupyter-disconnect-client'. The communication layer deals
;; with "events" which are just lists with an identifying symbol as the head
;; element. Events that occur on the communication layer meant for clients,
;; e.g. a message received by a kernel or notification that a message was sent
;; to a kernel, will be broadcast to all registered clients. Every client
;; wanting to receive such events must extend the method
;; `jupyter-event-handler' using the head method specializer.
;;
;; An event is sent to the kernel using `jupyter-send'. So that sending an
;; event to the communication layer would look like
;;
;;     (jupyter-send kcomm 'send channel-type msg-type msg msg-id)
;;
;; The possible events that can be handled by a client is dependent on the
;; communication layer, but a `jupyter-kernel-client' implements handlers for a
;; `message' event (a kernel message) and a `sent' event (a notification that a
;; message was sent to a kernel).
