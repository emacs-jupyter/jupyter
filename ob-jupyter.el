;;; Commentary:

;; TODO: Properly replace the source block results when multiple results are
;; appended. Currently what happens is that only the first result is removed
;; when re-execution the src block due to the behavior of
;; `org-babel-result-end'. The solution is to keep calling
;; `org-babel-result-end' moving point to the end of the results until
;; `org-babel-result-end' returns the same position twice. We may need to
;; advise this function to implement this behavior for jupyter blocks.
;;
;; An alternative is to collect all results in both async and sync cases before
;; insertion. Then if there are multiple types of data, for example images and
;; text, we can insert them all into a single RESULTS drawer.
