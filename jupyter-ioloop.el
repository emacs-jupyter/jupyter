;;; Commentary:

;; An ioloop encapsulates a subprocess that communicates with its parent
;; process in a pre-defined way.  The parent process sends events (lists with a
;; head element tagging the type of event and the rest of the elements being
;; the arguments), via a call to the `jupyter-send' method of a
;; `jupyter-ioloop'.  The ioloop subprocess then handles the event in its
;; environment.  You add an event that can be handled in the ioloop environment
;; by calling `jupyter-ioloop-add-event' before calling `jupyter-ioloop-start'.
;;
;; In the event handler of the ioloop, you may optionally return another event
;; back to the parent process.  In this case, when the parent process receives
;; the event it is dispatched to an appropriate `jupyter-ioloop-handler'.
;;
;; An example that will echo back what was sent to the ioloop as a message in
;; the parent process:
;;
;; (cl-defmethod jupyter-ioloop-handler ((ioloop jupyter-ioloop) (tag (eql :tag1)) (event (head echo)))
;;   (message "%s" (cadr event)))
;;
;; (let ((ioloop (jupyter-ioloop))
;;   (jupyter-ioloop-add-event ioloop echo (data)
;;     "Return DATA back to the parent process."
;;     (list 'echo data))
;;   (jupyter-ioloop-start ioloop :tag1)
;;   (jupyter-send ioloop 'echo "Message")
;;   (jupyter-ioloop-stop ioloop))

  :documentation "An interface for sending asynchronous messages via a subprocess.

An ioloop starts an Emacs subprocess setup to send events back
and forth between the parent Emacs process and the ioloop
asynchronously.  The ioloop subprocess is essentially a polling
loop that polls its stdin and any sockets that may have been
created in the ioloop environment and performs pre-defined
actions when stdin sends an event.  The structure of the
subprocess is the following

\(progn
  (let ((jupyter-ioloop-poller (zmq-poller)))
    <jupyter-ioloop-setup>
    <send start event to parent>
    (condition-case nil
      (while t
        (run-hook 'jupyter-ioloop-pre-hook)
        <poll for stdin/socket events>
        (run-hook 'jupyter-ioloop-post-hook))
     (quit
       <jupyter-ioloop-teardown>
       <send quit event to parent>))))

<jupyter-ioloop-setup> is replaced by the form in the setup slot
of an ioloop and can be conveniently added to using
`jupyter-ioloop-add-setup'.

<jupyter-ioloop-teardown> is replaced with the teardown slot and
can be added to using `jupyter-ioloop-add-teardown'.

<poll for stdin/socket events> is replaced by code that will
listen for stdin/socket events using `jupyter-ioloop-poller'.

You add events to be handled by the subprocess using
`jupyter-ioloop-add-event', the return value of any event added
is what is sent to the parent Emacs process and what will
eventually be used as the EVENT argument of
`jupyter-ioloop-handler', which see.  To suppress the subprocess
from sending anything back to the parent, ensure nil is returned
by the form created by `jupyter-ioloop-add-event'.

See `jupyter-channel-ioloop' for an example of its usage.")

      (jupyter-stop-channel channel))

an event like

    (jupyter-send ioloop 'stop-channel :shell)

`jupyter-ioloop-add-event' is called in the IOLOOP environment,
