;;; Commentary:

;; Implements synchronous channel types using ZMQ sockets.  Each channel is
;; essentially a wrapper around a `zmq-socket' constrained to a socket type by
;; the type of the channel and with an associated `zmq-IDENTITY' obtained from
;; the `jupyter-session' that must be associated with the channel.  A heartbeat
;; channel is distinct from the other channels in that it is implemented using
;; a timer which periodically pings the kernel depending on how its configured.
;; In order for communication to occur on the other channels, one of
;; `jupyter-send' or `jupyter-recv' must be called after starting the channel
;; with `jupyter-start-channel'.
