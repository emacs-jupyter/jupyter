;;; Commentary:

;; A communication layer using `jupyter-zmq-channel' objects for communicating
;; with a kernel.  This communication layer is mainly meant for speed comparison
;; with the `jupyter-channel-ioloop-comm' layer.  It implements communication in
;; the current Emacs instance and comparing it with the
;; `jupyter-channel-ioloop-comm' shows how much of a slow down there is when
;; all the processing of messages happens in the current Emacs instance.
;;
;; Running the test suit using `jupyter-zmq-channel-comm' vs
;; `jupyter-channel-ioloop-comm' shows, very roughly, around a 2x speed up
;; using `jupyter-channel-ioloop-comm'.
