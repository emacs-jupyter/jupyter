When this variable is nil and, for example, multiple source

\"execute_request\" messages are sent to the kernel immediately
and are queued on the kernel side so that when one of the source
blocks raises an error, the kernel will typically just execute
the next \"execute_request\" message queued up so the effect is
that source blocks that come after the failed one are executed.
Some may find this behavior undesirable.

Instead, when this variable is non-nil, the \"execute_request\"
messages of the source blocks are queued on the client side and
whenever one of the source blocks raises an error, all of the
queued \"execute_request\" messages are aborted and don't get
sent to the kernel so the effect is that source blocks that come
after the failed one are not executed."
