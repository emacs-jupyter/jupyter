;;; Commentary:

;; A `jupyter-channel-ioloop' using `jupyter-zmq-channel' to send and receive
;; messages.  Whenever a message is received on a channel an event that looks
;; like the following will be sent back to the parent process
;;
;;     (message CHANNEL-TYPE IDENTS . MSG)
;;
;; where CHANNEL-TYPE is the channel on which the message was received (one of
;; `jupyter-socket-types'), IDENTS are ZMQ identities, typically ignored, and
;; MSG is the message plist.
