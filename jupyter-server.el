;;; Commentary:

;; Overview of implementation
;;
;; A `jupyter-server' communicates with a Jupyter kernel server (either the
;; notebook or a kernel gateway) via the Jupyter REST API.  Given the URL and
;; Websocket URL for the server, the `jupyter-server' object can launch kernels
;; using the function `jupyter-server-start-new-kernel'.  The kernelspecs
;; available on the server can be accessed by calling
;; `jupyter-server-kernelspecs'.
;;
;; `jupyter-server-start-new-kernel' returns a list (KM KC) where KM is a
;; `jupyter-server-kernel-manager' and KC is a kernel client that can
;; communicate with the kernel managed by KM.  `jupyter-server-kernel-manager'
;; sends requests to the server using the `jupyter-server' object to manage the
;; lifetime of the kernel and ensures that a websocket is opened so that kernel
;; clients created using `jupyter-make-client' can communicate with the kernel.
;;
;; Communication with the channels of the kernels that are launched on the
;; `jupyter-server' is established via a `jupyter-server-ioloop' which
;; multiplexes the channels of all the kernel servers.  The kernel ID the server
;; associated with a kernel can then be used to filter messages for a
;; particular kernel and to send messages to a kernel through the
;; `jupyter-server-ioloop'.
;;
;; `jupyter-server-kernel-comm' is a `jupyter-comm-layer' that handles the
;; communication of a client with a server kernel.  The job of the
;; `jupyter-server-kernel-comm' is to connect to the `jupyter-server's event
;; stream and filter the messages to handle those of a particular kernel
;; identified by kernel ID.
;;
;; Starting REPLs
;;
;; You can launch kernels without connecting clients to them by using
;; `jupyter-server-launch-kernel'.  To connect a REPL to a launched kernel use
;; `jupyter-connect-server-repl'.  To both launch and connect a REPL use
;; `jupyter-run-server-repl'.  All of the previous commands determine the server
;; to use by using the `jupyter-current-server' function, which see.
;;
;; Managing kernels on a server
;;
;; To get an overview of all live kernels on a server you can call
;; `jupyter-server-list-kernels'.  From the buffer displayed there are a number
;; of keys bound that enable you to manage the kernels on the server.  See
;; `jupyter-server-kernel-list-mode-map'.
;;
;; TODO: Find where it would be appropriate to call `delete-instance' on a
;;`jupyter-server' that does not have any websockets open, clients connected,
;; or HTTP connections open, or is not bound to `jupyter-current-server' in any
;; buffer.
